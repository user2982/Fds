Installing Method

1) Numpy
Numpy is a numerical computing package for mathematics, science, and engineering.
Many data science packages use Numpy as a dependency.
Command: pip install numpy

2) Pandas
Pandas visualizes and manipulates datatables. There are many functions that allow
efficient manipulation for the preliminary steps of data analysis problems.
Command: pip install pandas

3) Statsmodel
Statsmodels is a package for exploring data, estimating statistical models, and
performing statistical tests. It include descriptive statistics, statistical 
tests, plotting functions, and result statiscs.
Command: pip install statsmodel

4) Scipy
Scipy is a general-purpose package for mathematics, science, and engineering and
extends the base capapabilities of Numpy.
Command: pip install scipy

5) Jupyter
It is used to create interactive notebook documents that can contain live code,
equations, visualizations, media and other computational outputs. Jupyter Notebook
is often used by programmers, data scientists and students to document and
demonstrate coding workflows or simply experiment with code.
Command: pip install jupyter
